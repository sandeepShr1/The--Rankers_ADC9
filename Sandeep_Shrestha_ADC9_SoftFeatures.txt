Git is the most popular distributed version-control system which is mostly used in software development. 
Using Git is very useful and can highly improve your workflow. The most important question is: 
where can you learn Git easily?

Before going into detail, let’s break down the name to better understand what we are dealing with.

Version Control System (VCS)
This is an application to track changes in files. It is commonly used when several people work on
 a single file, or code in software development. The app will document all changes made to the file  
 you’ll be able to see who made the change, what and when they changed, suggestions, comments and more.
Distributed
Basically, there are two types of VCS: Centralized VCS and Distributed VCS. The former keeps 
the history of changes on a central server, which means that you need to be online to access 
the file. A request or permission is also required if anyone wants to get the latest version 
and change it. The latter provides everyone with a copy of the history on their local servers, 
thus enabling them to work independently, and make any changes they want.
